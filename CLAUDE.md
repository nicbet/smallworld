# Exponential Agent Instructions

This project uses `xpo` (Exponential) via the MCP server registered in `.mcp.json`.
Always use the MCP tools — never shell out to the `xpo` CLI.

Issue IDs in this project use the prefix `projects-` (e.g. `projects-a1b2c3`).

## Hard Rules

1. Every code change must be backed by an xpo issue transitioned to DOING before any file is modified.
2. Never start work on a BACKLOG issue without explicit user approval to transition it.
3. Bugs discovered during implementation may be filed and fixed without approval — file the issue, link it to the current work, and fix it.
4. Before beginning any implementation task, load the `xpo-workflow` skill and follow it.
5. If an MCP tool call fails, report the error to the user. Never fall back to the CLI.

## Agent Identity

Set the `assignee` field to yourself when transitioning an issue to DOING. Use the form
`<Agent Name> <agent@<host>.local>` — e.g. `Claude Code <agent@macbook.local>`.
